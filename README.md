# Face Recognition Project

This is a real- time Face Recognition system bulit using python and OpenCV.

##Featuers
-> Collect custom dataset using camera
-> Train model using LBPH(Local Binary Patterns Histograms) Face Recognizer
-> Real-time recognition with confidence threshold

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install opencv-contrib-python numpy
3. Collect dataset(optional if dataset already exists)
4. Train model:
   python train_model.py
6. Run recognition:
   python recognize.py

## Tech Stack
-> Python 3.10
-> OpenCV (opencv-contrib-python)
-> NumPy
